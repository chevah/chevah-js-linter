# Chevah JS Linter - a fork of Closure Linter
# Closure Linter - a style checker for ES5 JavaScript

Since **closure linter is deprecated** I have forked it in an attempt to delay
the migration to Java based tool and be able to continue to use Python.

It has the same command names as Closure Linter.

## Installation

To install the application, run `python ./setup.py install`

After installing, you get two helper applications installed into `/usr/local/bin`:

* `gjslint.py` - runs the linter and checks for errors
* `fixjsstyle.py` - tries to fix errors automatically


## Testing

Using setuptools: `python setup.py test`
Using virtualenv: `python closure_linter/full_test.py`
